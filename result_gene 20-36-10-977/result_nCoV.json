The DEG data shows significant differential expression indicating its involvement in disease processes under study, with a highly significant p-value (pval = 1.158e-53). DUSP1 is known to negatively regulate MAPK signal transduction pathways, which are critical in inflammatory responses often implicated in COVID-19 pathology.\n\n2. **FOS**: The FOS gene is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, playing a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The associated TF enrichments like IL-17 signaling and apoptosis are pertinent given IL-17's role in inflammatory responses seen in infections like COVID-19. The logFC (1.545) and significant p-value of 2.170e-49 further suggest its active role under the disease conditions explored in this study. The FOS family\u2019s involvement in immune response regulation makes it a relevant novel target, especially given inflammatory and immune response deregulation in COVID-19.\n\nBoth genes exhibit interactions with pathways and cellular processes that are relevant to the pathogenesis and progression of viral infections, including immune and stress responses, making them relevant targets for further functional studies or therapeutic interventions in the context of COVID-19 and flu."

The associated TF enrichments like IL-17 signaling and apoptosis are pertinent given IL-17's role in inflammatory responses seen in infections like COVID-19. The logFC (1.545) and significant p-value of 2.170e-49 further suggest its active role under the disease conditions explored in this study. The FOS family\u2019s involvement in immune response regulation makes it a relevant novel target, especially given inflammatory and immune response deregulation in COVID-19.\n\nBoth genes exhibit interactions with pathways and cellular processes that are relevant to the pathogenesis and progression of viral infections, including immune and stress responses, making them relevant targets for further functional studies or therapeutic interventions in the context of COVID-19 and flu."

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in the inhibition of casein kinase and altered expression of this protein is associated with the disease cystic fibrosis. This antimicrobial protein exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014].",
