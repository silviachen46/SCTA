        "reasoning": "IL7R is selected due to its involvement in immune regulation and significant differential expression in luminal epithelial cells and secretory epithelial cells, which are pertinent in prostate cancer biology. It is also associated with the 'FoxO signaling pathway' which plays a role in tumor suppression, thus making it a promising target for prostate adenocarcinoma.\n\nKLF3 has a significant role in transcriptional regulation and is shown to have differential expression in macrophages, which are crucial players in the tumor microenvironment. Its relevance in 'Transcriptional misregulation in cancer' pathways further suggests its potential in cancer biology, particularly in the context of prostate tumors.\n\nNEU1, although with less significant transcription factor pathway enrichment, shows a substantial differential expression in relevant epithelial cell types. This gene is involved in lysosomal functions and regulation of metabolic processes, which are critical in cancer cell survival and adaptation, making NEU1 a potential novel target in cancer treatment strategies. The significant DEG profiles in relevant cell types support further investigation into its role in prostate adenocarcinoma."
